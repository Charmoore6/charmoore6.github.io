	<br>
	<p>One of the most powerful ways to learn a language; and especially to acquire and expand your own second language vocabulary, is with SRS. SRS stands for <em>space repetition software</em>, and is based on the core idea of that we memorize and store things into our long-time memory when we encounter it again right before we forget the information.
	The software, based on an algorithm, will schedule when you next see the question or information based on how difficult your perceive answering the question to be. The basic concept of spaced repetition software is based on the <em>Leitner system</em>:  a memorization method developed by the German scientist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s.</p>.<br>

	<p>In the Leitner system, questions successfully answered by the learner move forward in the “boxes”, resulting in the learner encountering them less frequently. Questions not answered successfully are moved backward or do not progress, resulting in the learner encounter the question more frequently. </p>
